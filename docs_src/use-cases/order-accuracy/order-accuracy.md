# Intel速 Order Accuracy Reference Package

## Overview

As computer vision technology becomes more mainstream in industrial and retail settings, using it for order accuracy in quick service restaurants is becoming increasingly complex. These vision workloads are substantial and require multiple stages of processing. For example, a typical order accuracy pipeline might capture video data and use an object detection model like YOLO V11 to identify items such as sandwiches, fries, and drinks placed on trays or tables. The results are then post-processed to generate metadata highlighting which food items were served.

Implementing order accuracy solutions in retail isn't straightforward. Retailers, independent software vendors (ISVs), and system integrators (SIs) need a solid understanding of both hardware and software, as well as the costs involved in setting up and scaling these systems. Given the data-intensive nature of vision workloads, systems must be carefully designed, built, and deployed with numerous considerations in mind. Effectively combating shrinkage requires the right mix of hardware, software, and optimized configurations.

The Intel速 Order Accuracy  Reference Package is designed to help with this. It provides the essential components needed to develop and deploy a order accuracy  solution using Intel速 hardware, software, and open-source tools. This reference implementation includes a pre-configured pipeline that's optimized for Intel速 hardware, simplifying the setup of an effective computer vision-based order accuracy system for retailers.
