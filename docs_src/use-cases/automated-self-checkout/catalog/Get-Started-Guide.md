# Getting Started Guide

-   **Time to Complete:** 30 minutes
-   **Programming Language:** Python*3, Bash*
  
## Prerequisites for Target System

* Intel® Core™ processor
* At least 16 GB RAM
* At least 64 GB hard drive
* An Internet connection
* Docker*
* Docker Compose* v2 (Optional)
* Git*
* Ubuntu* LTS Boot Device

If Ubuntu is not installed on the target system, follow the instructions and [install Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop/).

## Install Automated Self-Checkout Package Software

Do the following to install the software package:

   1. Download the reference implementation package:
      [Automated Self-Checkout Retail Reference Implementation](https://edgesoftware.intel.com/automated-self-checkout).

   1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the download folder to unzip the ``automated-self-checkout`` package:

      ``` bash
         unzip automated-self-checkout.zip
      ```

   1. Navigate to the ``automated-self-checkout/`` directory:

      ``` bash
       cd automated-self-checkout
      ```

   1. Change permission of the executable edgesoftware file:
      
      ``` bash
         chmod 755 edgesoftware
      ```

   1. Install the package:

      ``` bash
         ./edgesoftware install
      ```

   1. You will be prompted for the Product Key during the installation. The Product Key is in the email you received from Intel confirming your download.

      When the installation is complete, you will see the message “Installation of package complete” and the installation status for each module.

   If the installation fails because of proxy-related issues, follow the [troubleshooting steps](#troubleshooting).

## Run and Evaluate Pre-Configured Pipelines

In a retail environment, self-checkout solutions analyze video streams from multiple cameras to streamline the checkout process. The system detects and classifies products as items are scanned. Barcode and text recognition ensure accuracy. This data is processed to verify purchases and update inventory in real time. Factors such as latency and frames per second (FPS) help assess the automated self-checkout solution's real-time responsiveness and efficiency.

This demonstration shows how to run the pre-configured pipeline, view a simulation that detects and tracks objects, and check the pipeline's status.

## Step 1: Run Pipeline

Do the following to run the pre-configured pipeline:

   1. Navigate to the ``automated-self-checkout`` directory:

      ``` bash
         cd automated-self-checkout
      ```

   1. Modify the following host IP addresses to match the IP address of the system running the reference implementation: 

      * ``HOST_IP`` and ``RSTP_CAMERA_IP`` in the ``src/pipeline-server/.env`` file. 
      * ``host_ip`` in the ``src/pipeline-server/postman/env.json`` file.

   1. Run the pipeline server:

      ``` bash
         make run-pipeline-server
      ```

      The containers will start to run.

      ![Figure 4: Pipeline Status](images/automated-selfcheckout-run-pipeline.png)

## Step 2: Launch Grafana Dashboard

Do the following to launch the Grafana* dashboard to view the objects being detected and tracked:

   1. Open a web browser and enter the following URL to access the Grafana dashboard:
      ``http://<target_system_IP>:3000``.

      To get ``<target_system_IP>``, run the ``hostname -I`` command.

   1. When prompted, provide the following credentials:
      
      * Username: ``root``
      * Password: ``evam123``

   1. On the dashboard, go to **Menu** > **Home**, and select **Video Analytics Dashboard**.

      The dashboard visualizes the object detection and tracking pipelines. The bounding boxes around the products indicate their detection and tracking. The dashboard also shows the active streams and their corresponding average FPS.

      ![Figure 5: Object Detection and Tracking](images/automated-selfcheckout-grafana.png)

## Step 3: Check Pipeline Status

Do the following to check the metrics: 

   1.  Check whether the docker containers are running:

      ``` bash
         docker ps --format 'table{{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.Status}}'
      ```
      ![Figure 6: Docker Container Status](images/automated-selfcheckout-pipeline-status.png)

   1.  Check the MQTT inference output:

      ``` bash
         mosquitto_sub -v -h localhost -p 1883 -t 'AnalyticsData0'
         mosquitto_sub -v -h localhost -p 1883 -t 'AnalyticsData1'
         mosquitto_sub -v -h localhost -p 1883 -t 'AnalyticsData2'
      ```

      Here is the result for ``AnalyticsData0``:

      ``` shell
         AnalyticsData0 {"objects":[{"detection":{"bounding_box":{"x_max":0.3163176067521043,"x_min":0.20249048400491532,"y_max":0.7995593662281202,"y_min":0.12237883070032396},"confidence":0.868196964263916,"label":"bottle","label_id":39},"h":731,"region_id":6199,"roi_type":"bottle","w":219,"x":389,"y":132},{"detection":{"bounding_box":{"x_max":0.7833052431819754,"x_min":0.6710088227893136,"y_max":0.810283140877349,"y_min":0.1329853767638305},"confidence":0.8499506711959839,"label":"bottle","label_id":39},"h":731,"region_id":6200,"roi_type":"bottle","w":216,"x":1288,"y":144}],"resolution":{"height":1080,"width":1920},"tags":{},"timestamp":67297301635}

         AnalyticsData0 {"objects":[{"detection":{"bounding_box":{"x_max":0.3163306922646063,"x_min":0.20249845268772138,"y_max":0.7984013488063937,"y_min":0.12254781445953},"confidence":0.8666459321975708,"label":"bottle","label_id":39},"h":730,"region_id":6201,"roi_type":"bottle","w":219,"x":389,"y":132},{"detection":{"bounding_box":{"x_max":0.7850104587729607,"x_min":0.6687324296210857,"y_max":0.7971464600783804,"y_min":0.13681757042794374},"confidence":0.8462932109832764,"label":"bottle","label_id":39},"h":713,"region_id":6202,"roi_type":"bottle","w":223,"x":1284,"y":148}],"resolution":{"height":1080,"width":1920},"tags":{},"timestamp":67330637174}
      ```

   1.  Check the pipeline status:

      ``` bash
         ./src/pipeline-server/status.sh 
      ```
      The pipeline status should be like:

      ``` shell
         --------------------- Pipeline Status ---------------------
         ----------------8080----------------
         [
         {
               "avg_fps": 11.862402507697258,
               "avg_pipeline_latency": 0.5888091060475129,
               "elapsed_time": 268.07383918762207,
               "id": "95204aba458211efa9080242ac180006",
               "message": "",
               "start_time": 1721361269.6349292,
               "state": "RUNNING"
         }
         ]
      ```   

      The pipeline status displays the average FPS and average pipeline latency, among other metrics. 

   1. Stop the services:

      ``` bash
         make down-pipeline-server
      ```
