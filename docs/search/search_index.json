Specifically for <code>yolov5s</code> object detection, it is recommended to use the model precision FP32 when it is running on device <code>GPU</code>.  If supported, then you can change the model precision by updating the pipeline script to point to the precision of your choice.  For example, you can change the model of <code>FP16</code> to <code>FP32</code> assuming the precision <code>FP32</code> of the target model is available:  </p> <pre><code>    src/pipelines/yolov5s.sh\n\n    ...\n    model=models/object_detection/yolov5s/FP16-INT8/yolov5s.xml\n    ...\n</code></pre> <p>Q: What happens if the system keeps crashing when building the <code>dlstreamer-realsense</code> image?</p> <p>A: Some systems may run into issues with memory when building the <code>dlstreamer-realsense</code> image. In the <code>Dockerfile.dlstreamer</code> file, change the make command to not use the <code>-j</code> threading option.</p> <pre><code>- make -j\"$(cat &lt; /proc/cpuinfo |grep -c proc)\" &amp;&amp;\n+ make &amp;&amp;\n</code></pre> <p>Q: What happens if the RTSP source is not found?</p> <p>A: Depending on your systems performance it is possible that the RTSP simulator may take additional time to initialize and start streaming. To avoid issues you can add a waiting period before the pipeline starts. For example you can add a 5 second sleep timer to /src/entrypoint.sh</p> <pre><code>sleep 5 # sleep for 5 seconds before starting the pipeline\neval $gstLaunchCmd\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Architecture/pipelines.html","title":"Intel Retail","text":""},{"location":"Architecture/pipelines.html#repositories","title":"Repositories","text":"<p>In release v3.0.0 Intel-retail modules have been organized into logical repositories.

Vision workloads are large and complex and need to go through many stages.

This pipeline is just an example of the supported models and pipelines found within this reference.</p> <p></p> <p>Automated self-checkout solutions are complex, and retailers, independent software vendors (ISVs), and system integrators (SIs) require a good understanding of hardware and software, the costs involved in setting up and scaling the system, and the configuration that best suits their needs. Vision workloads are significantly larger and require systems to be architected, built, and deployed with several considerations. Hence, a set of ingredients needed to create an automated self-checkout solution is necessary.

These vision workloads are substantial and require multiple stages of processing. For example, a typical loss prevention pipeline might capture video data, define regions of interest, implement tracking to monitor which products customers interact with, analyze the data using models like YOLOv5 and EfficientNet, and then post-process it to generate metadata that highlights which products are being purchased or potentially stolen. This is just one example of how such models and workflows can be utilized.</p> <p>Implementing loss prevention solutions in retail isn't straightforward. Retailers, independent software vendors (ISVs), and system integrators (SIs) need a solid understanding of both hardware and software, as well as the costs involved in setting up and scaling these systems. Given the data-intensive nature of vision workloads, systems must be carefully designed, built, and deployed with numerous considerations in mind. Effectively combating shrinkage requires the right mix of hardware, software, and optimized configurations.</p> <p>The Intel\u00ae Loss Prevention Reference Package is designed to help with this. It provides the essential components needed to develop and deploy a loss prevention solution using Intel\u00ae hardware, software, and open-source tools. This reference implementation includes a pre-configured pipeline that's optimized for Intel\u00ae hardware, simplifying the setup of an effective computer vision-based loss prevention system for retailers.</p>"},{"location":"use-cases/loss-prevention/loss-prevention.html#next-steps","title":"Next Steps","text":"<p>To begin using the loss prevention solution you can follow the Getting Started Guide. </p>"}]}
